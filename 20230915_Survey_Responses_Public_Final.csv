P*2,comment only ->,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*2,"Very interesting. There was one thing I wondered about. The options don't clarify if something was important towards the decision or was a strike against it but mitigated by other factors.
For example, a pilot with lots of crashes is a red flag... but with a relatively low risk flight and a drone with additional safety feature it's less of a problem.
A low altitude flight over some farmland close-ish to an airport is less worrying than the same pilot flying downtown for a wedding photoshoot.
Maybe if you are gathering another round of data, having an ""important but opposing the decision"" would be useful."
P*3,comment only ->,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*3,"What actual airspace type is to be used? At what altitude?
Perhaps most importantly, why is that airspace otherwise closed to drone operations? Why is a special request needed for this mission?
Pilot experience is irrelevant to an extent - I want to know what his/her qualifications are. Is it expected that an approving official will review the resume and flight history of both the pilot and the aircraft? That’s a silly assumption. The pilot is either qualified/certified in the operations to be performed or not. Same goes for the airframe.
What are the actual hazards? “A few drones and other air traffic” gives exactly zero information upon which to make a decision. Same goes for “Human traffic: Normal.” What mitigations exist to avoid these hazards? You seem only to hint at sense and avoid technology, but traffic conflicts can be avoided laterally, via altitude separation, and by time/scheduling. Similar with ground hazards. The existence of a risk isn’t enough information upon which to make a decision - it’s the mitigation that is key.
Actual weather conditions are immaterial in such a request (as they are impossible to forecast accurately on a timeline for which a waiver might be granted). An approval to such a request would likely state minimum acceptable conditions."
