How will ""Al"" system be better than simple rules based on the same score system?"
P*2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*2,"Very interesting. There was one thing I wondered about. The options don't clarify if something was important towards the decision or was a strike against it but mitigated by other factors.
For example, a pilot with lots of crashes is a red flag... but with a relatively low risk flight and a drone with additional safety feature it's less of a problem.
A low altitude flight over some farmland close-ish to an airport is less worrying than the same pilot flying downtown for a wedding photoshoot.
Maybe if you are gathering another round of data, having an ""important but opposing the decision"" would be useful."
P*3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*3,"When accounting for pilot experience and prior incidents, where would that data come from? I have thousands of flights, but plenty of those aren't linked to any single account or database.
I work in emergency operations. How would AI be able to determine exigency or severity of an incident when making an approval decision?"
P*5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*4,"Assessment should be risk based. And the truth is that most camera drones pose close to zero risk to people or aircraft.
The entire manned aviation system is based around minimizing fatalities.  By that metric sUAS have a perfect record yet the FAA restricts based on the chance someone might need a bandaid."
P*6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P*5,I'm not sure I'm keen on an algorithm deciding if I can fly my drone and I feel there needs to be a bit more transparency in this survey and project.
